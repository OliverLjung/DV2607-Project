# DV2607-Project

Project for course: DV2607 Security in AI-systems

GAN discriminators are BID models trained on adveserial instances, adveserial training. 
The generated instances should go from random pertubation and coverge to something closely resembelling the dataset it was trained on.
The models have no internal access to its target model, only the prediction that it makes.
Can this technique be used to train a robust evasion attack detector?

This Project uses TensorFlow, Keras and Adveserial-Robust-Toolbox as well as standard python libaries.
